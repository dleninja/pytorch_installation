# Pytorch

Pytorch is an open source machine learning framework developed by Meta AI (Facebook). Currently it is the second-fastest-growing open source project on Github and therefore many companies are adopting Pytorch for their research and production. For example Microsoft has been using Pytorch for their language modelling service, Toyota Research Institute has used it for high-resolution sensory output for videos, Genentech has been using Pytorch for their personalised cancer medicine, therapy and drug discovery. Therefore, in the goal of this repository is to provide a simple guide to install and run Pytorch.

## Pytorch Installation

In this repository we will be following this [guide](https://www.linode.com/docs/guides/pytorch-installation-ubuntu-2004/).

To keep all our related libraries localized, I will be creating a virtual environment on Ubuntu 20.04.

## Step 0: Virtual Environment (Optional)

To create a virtual environment, we can use the [Virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/) package.
